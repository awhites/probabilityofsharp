# C# Probability Calculator Learning Simulation
Dummy c# project 


## The Story Begins
Your ruling overlords have decided that they are looking for tool that will allow them to enter probabilities and carry out basic calculations. The program should also log each calculation for later analysis (No DB required, just log to a text file). 

### The calculator
The user should be able to enter two valid probabilities (0 to 1 e.g. 0.5 is valid while 1.1 or -0.1 is invalid). The user should be able to choose from the following functions:
1.	CombinedWith: P(A)P(B) e.g. 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25
2.	Either:P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B) e.g. 0.5 + 0.5 â€“ 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.75
### What to build
1.	Use a technology you feel comfortable with (Windows Forms, Web API, MVC, JavaScript, etc.)
2.	A way for users to enter two numbers and see a calculated result
3.	A log that includes the date, type of calculation, the inputs and the result
### What they  want to see
1.	Maintainable code that is easy to extend
2.	The project contains some degree of tests
Be prepared to explain your choices.
